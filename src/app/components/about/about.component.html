      This chatbot is powered by a Large Language Model trained on the contents
      of The Library of Babel, as described by Jorge Luis Borges in his
      <a href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf" target="_blank">short story of the same name</a>. That is - every possible text
      consisting of every possible combination of 29 characters (the letters of
      the alphabet, plus the comma, period and space). This painstaking process
      means that the model has been exposed to the sum total of human knowledge,
      as well as all possible knowledge. For the first time, anyone is able to
      interact with the Library through a convenient chatbot.

    <p>As Borges writes, the Library contains</p>
    <p class="quote">
      All â€” the detailed history of the future, the autobiographies of the
      archangels, the faithful catalog of the Library, thousands and thousands
      of false catalogs, the proof of the falsity of those false catalogs, a
      proof of the falsity of the true catalog, the gnostic gospel of Basilides,
      the commentary upon that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that
      gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book into
      every language, the interpolations of every book into all books, the
      treatise Bede could have written (but did not) on the mythology of the
      Saxon people, the lost books of Tacitus.
